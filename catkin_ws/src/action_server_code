This code is run in the command prompt during the perception stage to deliver the node goal for the find_objects result into RVIZ for visualisation. This result is then used to inform the pick_and_place.launch about its worktop and the manipulable objects.

First, run:

rostopic echo /basic_grasping_perception/find_objects/result


Second, run:

rostopic pub /basic_grasping_perception/find_objects/goal grasping_msgs/FindGraspableObjectsActionGoal "header:
  seq: 0
  stamp:
    secs: 0
    nsecs: 0
  frame_id: 'base_link'
goal_id:
